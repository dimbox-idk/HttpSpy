# HttpSpy

HttpSpy is a powerful and efficient network debugging tool for Roblox, designed for both developers and exploiters. With its advanced features, HttpSpy allows you to monitor and manipulate HTTP requests seamlessly.

I don't know if the code works or not; feel free to make an issue!
The foundation of the code was created by ChatGPT, along with the entire code.

## üìñ Usage

Before running your target script, make sure to execute HttpSpy:
```Lua
local HttpSpy = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimbox-idk/HttpSpy/main/init.lua"))({
    SaveLogs = true,          -- Save logs to a text file
    ShowResponse = true,      -- Displays the request response in the console
    BlockedURLs = {},         -- URLs to block
    API = true                -- Enables the HttpSpy API
})
```

## üìã Features

- **Request Reconstruction**: Monitor and manipulate HTTP requests.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on performance.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration.
- **Script API**: Programmatically control and customize HttpSpy.
- **Multi-Exploit Support**: Compatible with multiple exploits (including Solara and another externals).

## üì∏ Preview

uhhh, not now.

## üìú API

The following methods are available in the HttpSpy API:

HttpSpy:AddBlacklistedUrl(<string url>)                 -- Block a specific URL  
HttpSpy:SpoofUrl(<string url>, <string urlToSpoofWith>) -- Allow a specific URL  
HttpSpy:SpoofUrlResult(<string url>, <string result>)   -- Proxy a specific host to another  
HttpSpy:Toggle(<bool enabled>)                          -- Remove a proxy for a host  
HttpSpy.OnRequest:Connect(function(req) ... end)        -- Event triggered when a request is made  
HttpSpy:Destroy()                                       --  DESTROY httpspy, idk if after that secured scripts will be working

### Example Usage

local HttpSpy = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimbox-idk/HttpSpy/main/init.lua"))({
    SaveLogs = true,
    ShowResponse = true,
    BlockedURLs = {},
    API = true
})

HttpSpy.OnRequest:Connect(function(req) 
    warn("Request made:", req.Url)    
end)



print(request({ Url = "https://httpbin.org/get" }).Body)

HttpSpy:SpoofUrl("httpbin.org/get", "google.com")

print(request({ Url = "http://httpbin.org/get" }).Body)
