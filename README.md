The foundation of the code was created by ChatGPT, along with the entire code.

## üìñ Usage

Before running your target script, make sure to execute HttpSpy:
```Lua
local HttpSpy = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimbox-idk/HttpSpy/main/init.lua"))({
    SaveLogs = true,          -- Save logs to a text file
    ShowResponse = true,      -- Displays the request response in the console
    BlockedURLs = {},         -- URLs to block
    API = true                -- Enables the HttpSpy API
})
```

## üìã Features

- **Request Reconstruction**: Monitor and manipulate HTTP requests.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on performance.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration.

## üìú API

The following methods are available in the HttpSpy API:

HttpSpy:HookSynRequest(<string url>, <function hook>)  -- Hook into a request with a callback function  
HttpSpy:BlockUrl(<string url>)                          -- Block a specific URL  
HttpSpy:WhitelistUrl(<string url>)                       -- Allow a specific URL  
HttpSpy:ProxyHost(<string host>, <string proxy>)        -- Proxy a specific host to another  
HttpSpy:RemoveProxy(<string host>)                       -- Remove a proxy for a host  
HttpSpy:UnHookSynRequest(<string url>)                  -- Unhook a previously hooked request  
HttpSpy.OnRequest:Connect(function(req) ... end)        -- Event triggered when a request is made  

### Example Usage

local HttpSpy = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimbox-idk/HttpSpy/main/init.lua"))({
    SaveLogs = true,
    ShowResponse = true,
    BlockedURLs = {},
    API = true
})

HttpSpy.OnRequest:Connect(function(req) 
    warn("Request made:", req.Url)    
end)

HttpSpy:HookSynRequest("https://httpbin.org/get", function(response) 
    response.Body = "hooked!"
    return response
end)

print(request({ Url = "https://httpbin.org/get" }).Body)

HttpSpy:UnHookSynRequest("https://httpbin.org/get")
HttpSpy:ProxyHost("httpbin.org", "google.com")

print(request({ Url = "https://httpbin.org/get" }).Body)
